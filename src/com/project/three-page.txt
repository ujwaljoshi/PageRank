<p>A decision over whether Morocco will host the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) tournament is expected on Monday after a day of meetings between the Confederation of African Football (Caf) and Moroccan authorities.</p> <p>The north African country asked for the tournament – due to begin on 17 January – <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/16/morocco-africa-cup-of-nations-ebola-withdraw" title="">to be postponed due to the risk of the spread of the Ebola virus</a> affecting western Africa.</p> <p>According to reports from the Algeria Press Service, the executive committee of the Caf met the federation’s president, Issa Hayatou, the Algerian Football Federation president, Mohamed Rauraua, and the Egyptian CAF delegate, Hani Abourida, on Sunday.</p> <p>After recommendations from the national Health Ministry and the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Moroccan Ministry of Sport had asked for the tournament to be postponed to an unspecified date.</p> <p>“Our concern is the health of Africa and, based on WHO reports and guidelines, we have to listen,” said the sports minister, Mohamed Ouzzine.</p> <p>“Zero safety does not exist but one has to take the necessary precautions so that the coming tournament will be a football feast, bringing together our African brothers. But given the current Ebola situation we don’t think such a feast can take place as expected.”</p> <p>However, the Manchester City and Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Touré, who played in his club side’s 1-0 victory over Manchester United on Sunday, believes the tournament should take place as scheduled.</p> <p>“Me, I’m not really afraid,” <a href="http://www.europe1.fr/sport/football/articles/yaya-toure-j-espere-qu-on-pourra-jouer-la-can-2277537" title="">Touré told French radio station Europe 1 on Saturday</a>. “A very strong psychosis exists about this epidemic. The CAN is very important for Africa. It needs to take place.”</p>
<p>Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, has called for the US to enact a “temporary stop” of “elective travel” for people coming from west African nations that have seen Ebola outbreaks even as he questioned the quarantine of a Maine nurse who has tested negative for the disease.</p> <p>“If you’re coming to visit your relatives, couldn’t that wait for a few months?” <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/limit-elective-travel-from-west-africa-to-curb-ebola-spread-sen-rand-paul-says/">he said on CBS’s Face the Nation</a> on Sunday. “What I’m saying is elective travel, commercial travel for people who just want to visit the United States, that really isn’t a necessity.”<br /></p> <p>“The American public sees people getting it who are fully masked and gowned and saying, ‘My goodness, I don’t think anybody should be riding on a bus or coming from Liberia to visit their aunt or uncle when they could be contagious,” he said. </p> <p>He said the ban should not apply to humanitarian aid workers. <br /></p> <p>Paul, a doctor, has come under criticism recently for other statements about Ebola that seem to contradict that of medical officials. Last month, he accused the White House of underplaying how transmissible the disease is, suggesting it was more contagious than Aids. “If someone has Ebola at a cocktail party they’re contagious and you can catch it from them,” <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/16/politics/rand-paul-ebola-aids/">he said</a> then. </p> <p>Also appearing on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, Paul told Candi Crowley quarantines for returning aid workers are “reasonable precautions” but that he was unsettled by the treatment of Kaci Hickox, the Maine nurse who battled the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, and later the Maine governor, Paul LePage, over their attempts to quarantine her.<br /></p> <p>“The libertarian in me is horrified at the idea of indefinitely detaining or detaining anyone without a trial,” Paul said.<br /></p> <p>“One of the basic rights we inherited from the English and we got from common law was the right of habeas corpus … If the king were detaining you in the Tower of London, or a governor or anybody who is detaining you, you have to have recourse to a lawyer.”<br /></p> <p>“We have to be careful of people’s civil liberties,” he said. “But I’m not saying the government doesn’t have a role in trying to prevent contagion.”</p> <p>In an interview with the Maine Sunday Telegram on Sunday, Hickox defended her fight against the quarantine and said she was hopeful others returning from west Africa would be treated more fairly. </p> <p>“I hope in six months aid workers returning back can be unnoticed,” she told the newspaper. “They won’t be in the media like I was, I hope. And they can walk into a grocery store and maybe no one even knows they were working in a country with Ebola, but one day I hope everyone can know and still smile at them in the grocery store. I know that won’t happen today.”</p>
<p>Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder of France's far-right Front National, has suggested the deadly virus Ebola could solve the global "population explosion" and by extension Europe's "immigration problem".</p><p>At a cocktail party before an election rally in Marseille on Tuesday evening, days before the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/european-elections" title="">European elections</a> in which the FN is leading the polls in France, Le Pen spoke of the "demographic explosion" in the world.</p><p>"Monseigneur Ebola could sort that out in three months," he said in front of journalists.</p><p>Later, addressing supporters, Le Pen, 85, said he feared the French population risked being "replaced … by immigrants".</p><p>"In our country and in all Europe, we have known a cataclysmic phenomenon – a migratory invasion that, my friends, we are seeing only the beginning of today."</p><p>Le Pen, who is standing as MEP for the south-east seat, added: "This massive immigration risks producing a real replacement of populations if we don't arrive in power soon enough to put an end to the politics of decadence that has been followed for decades."</p><p>He said that religion added an "aggravating factor" to this problem because many immigrants were Muslim and Islam had a "conquering vocation … and even more conquering when it feels strong and they feel numerous"</p><p>S.peaking in Marseille, which elected an FN mayor in one of its districts in recent elections, Le Pen was followed on stage by his daughter, party president Marine.</p><p>Once again, her father undermined her campaign to convince voters the FN has evolved from its days as a vehicle for the extreme right and Nazi apologists.</p><p>Taking the microphone, Marine Le Pen continued with the twin pillars of the party's manifesto: the anti-immigration and anti-Europe.</p><p>"That's enough. We wish to become masters in our own home once again," she told the cheering audience.</p><p>She added that France was caught between "two steel jaws", saying: "On one side we have the importing of foreign cultures by a wave of foreigners who, unlike those who came before wish to impose a change on our behaviour and our lives. On the other side, there are the European commissioners who force their crazy administration on every aspect of our daily lives."</p><p>Opinion polls have suggested that the FN could score between 23% and 25% of the vote in France this Sunday, beating the opposition centre-right UMP party and the ruling Socialists.</p><p>Jean-Marie Le Pen has been accused and convicted several times of xenophobia and antisemitism. In February 2005 a court in Paris ruled that his remarks about Muslims in an interview with Le Monde constituted an incitement to racial hatred and he was fined €10,000 (£8,100) plus €5,000 in damages. The conviction and fines were upheld on appeal. In 1987 Le Pen said he supported the forced isolation of those infected with the HIV virus. In June 1996 he complained that the French World Cup football team contained too many non-white players.</p>
