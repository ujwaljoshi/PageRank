http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/05/ebola-journalist-arrested-over-criticism-sierra-leone-government-response <p>A journalist in Sierra Leone who has criticised the government’s handling of the Ebola outbreak was allegedly beaten then jailed under emergency laws meant to help bring the epidemic under control.</p> <p>David Tam Baryoh, a high-profile radio journalist whose reports have often needled officials, is being detained at the maximum-security Pademba Road prison in the capital Freetown. His popular weekly programme, Monologue, was taken off air mid-show last week as he interviewed an opposition party spokesman who criticised the president’s alleged intentions to run for a third term. During that show Baryoh also questioned arrests made in <a href="http://www.newctzen.com/index.php/11-news/986-24-hour-curfew-in-kono">Kono, an eastern district put under curfew in October</a> when a dispute between youths and police over a suspected case of Ebola <a href="https://witness.theguardian.com/assignment/541c1101e4b0e32cb9c53a41/1212840">degenerated into gunfire and rioting</a>.</p> <p>Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia between them now account for nearly 5,000 Ebola deaths, and have all declared states of emergency as cases continue to climb. But months into the outbreak, the growing epidemic has swept in a belated influx of international aid as well as political and social tensions as governments’ popularity ratings take a battering.</p> <p>Legislators in Sierra Leone threatened to gag the media over their coverage of the controversial allocation in September of 60m leones (£8,620) to each MP to boost Ebola awareness in their constituencies. In Liberia, the hardest-hit country, police last month used batons and whips to disperse protesters as lawmakers debated a request to extend president Ellen Johnson Sirleaf’s powers beyond the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/09/liberia-suspends-elections-ebola-outbreak">already sweeping ones accorded by the state of emergency declared in August</a>.</p> <p>Sierra Leone’s state of emergency empowers president Ernest Bai Koroma to arrest any person without a court order. An executive order to arrest Baryoh was signed by the president, chief superintendent Ibrahim Koroma told Reuters. “The powers were derived from the Ebola emergency regulations the country is currently under,” he said, without detailing the charges against the journalist or specifying the length of his detention.</p> <p>Local journalists said they fear a crackdown as they seek to keep on top of hundreds of millions of aid coming in. Residents, journalists and an official told the Guardian that trucks carrying food aid were sometimes parked outside quarantine cordons, which intended recipients couldn’t cross. The food was then looted by those meant to be distributing it. Burial teams have repeatedly gone on strike over unpaid hazard allowances.</p> <p>“People are feeling enraged because you can imagine you’ve lost two or three members of your family, and then someone comes knocking on your door with a bar of soap. That’s the only aid really filtering down to a lot of people,” a security adviser said.</p> <p>Almost a third of the amount pledged by the European Union will come from <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/23/uk-aid-ebola-epidemic-sierra-leone-eu-david-cameron">Britain’s £205m aid package</a>. Much of that has been channelled through established NGOs, or is handled directly by Britain, such as a UK-funded medical facility that opened its doors on Wednesday after British troops worked round-the-clock to construct it in eight weeks.</p> <p>But some inevitably disappears into government coffers in a nation that <a href="http://www.transparency.org/country#SLE">ranks 119 out of 177 on global corruption indexes</a>, while hundreds of thousands of pounds have also come from wealthy local donors, government supporters or multinationals. Last year, a number of top health officials were indicted for siphoning about $500,000 from a childhood immunisation fund sponsored by the Gates Foundation.</p> <p>“It’s a very tough time for journalists. A lot of money is moving around the country and we as journalists have to do our jobs and make sure it is being properly allocated,” said an local investigative reporter speaking on condition of anonymity.</p> <p>An associate said Baryoh was beaten some time between police storming his office on Sunday and his being examined by a prison doctor on Monday. A source who visited Baryoh in prison said he was unable to stand properly, and clutched at his knees before tottering to the ground. Baryoh suffers from high blood pressure, and is struggling with the crowded conditions of a jail that houses about four times its capacity of 324 inmates, the source added.</p> <p>“When the police arrested him in his office, there were six armed ones and a couple of plain clothes. They were really rough with him and threw away his blood pressure tablets,” a close friend of Baryoh’s told the Guardian. “A doctor has said he really needs to be in a hospital but officials made some excuse about no visitors because of Ebola, and shooed [the doctor] away.” Officials declined to comment on the allegations.</p> <p>Peter Nkanga, West Africa representative of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said: “Sierra Leone’s genuine state of emergency means that critical thinking and public debate are more important than ever. Locking away journalists without charge helps nobody.”</p> <p>Other reporters have been imprisoned in the notorious Pademba facility recently. <a href="http://en.rsf.org/sierra-leone-editorial-criticizing-president-24-10-2013,45375.html]">Jonathan Leigh and Bai Bai Sesay were held for four months after publishing an article which criticised the president</a>. All but one of the 26 charges against them were dropped upon their release in January.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/05/archbishop-war-ebola-reporters <p>The archbishop of Canterbury has praised the “extraordinary value” of frontline reporters covering overseas conflicts and the Ebola crisis for shining a light on “this darkening world”.</p> <p>Justin Welby said foreign correspondents and war reporters were a “God-given calling to inspire others to serve our common humanity” and helped challenge people’s complacency that what happened elsewhere in the world “did not matter”.</p> <p>Welby, delivering the sermon <a href="http://www.stbrides.com/news/2014/11/archbishop-to-attend-service-of-commemoration-for-fallen-journalists.html">at the annual journalists commemorative service </a>at St Bride’s Church in London’s Fleet Street, reflected on a year in which journalists faced an unprecedented threat from Islamic State (Isis) and the danger of reporting the Ebola outbreak from west Africa.</p> <p>“We live in a world where it feels as though the darkness is falling ever more severely on whole swathes and regions and in which the light of the news often seems to go out,” he said.</p> <p>“There are whole areas where there is fighting that is forgotten because there is so much of it, whole areas which depend on the likes of James Foley and Steven Sotloff [the US journalists murdered after being kidnapped by Isis in Syria] to show some light on what is happening.”</p> <p>Welby said frontline reporters were the “lookouts who stand on the watchtower” and paid a “profound cost” for what they saw, “sometimes deeply hurt mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually, even killed doing it”.</p> <p>“It is right and essential that we give thanks for those who witness, who unlock the covers of the wells of compassion that can become available, who challenge the complacency in which some people suggest that we can live in our own country as though the rest of the world did not matter,” he said.</p> <p>He said his experience of conflicts and meeting war correspondents “leads me to suggest, controversially, that it is just a little bit possible that they are not all entirely saintly at every minute of the day.</p> <p>“But there is an old saying in the church ... the fact that the priest is all messed up does not mess up the sacrament.”</p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="8c9fdb188a922ea88a5e9da946e77277a29a3844"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/5/1415208173041/4d025de9-ba8b-466a-bd93-4159b6b66afc-460x276.jpeg" alt="Archbishop of Canterbury during a service for journalists killed while reporting on the front line, at St Brides Church in London.

We ask how we got into this situation in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, why the World Health Organisation was so slow to respond, and what needs to happen in future to prevent a similar disaster.</p> <p>There have now been 13,703 officially registered Ebola cases and around 5,000 deaths, although it is estimated the true figure may be two to three times higher.</p> <p>In Liberia a slowdown has recently been noted with fewer burials and some empty beds in treatment centres, but experts say the numbers could easily rise again. Drug and vaccine trials are being expedited and will start in the outbreak countries in December, but the epidemic is still far from under control.</p> <p>I asked David Heymann, professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and head of the Centre on Global Health Security at Chatham House what part the poor healthcare system of Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea had played in the epidemic.</p> <p><strong>DH</strong> Well, I think it’s important to look at other countries which also have very weak health systems, such as Zaire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo today, and other countries where Ebola has occurred. The difference is not so much that it’s in urban areas with weak infrastructure, it’s that it wasn’t stopped when it was still rural.</p> <p>In rural areas where there’s better community organisation, village elders, village chiefs, traditional systems which help people better understand the cause of the disease and how to prevent spread, where the Red Cross and Red Crescent societies can work very freely to transport dead bodies and to transport patients and to spray the environment where patients have been held and also where contact tracing is easier and patient identification and isolation is also easier, it’s more easy to stop an outbreak and all previous outbreaks have been stopped in rural areas.</p> <p>These outbreaks did enter capital cities, an outbreak in 1995 in Zaire at that time entered Kinshasa, a city of 9 million, but the government was ready to jump on it right away with support from international partners and it didn’t spread.</p> <p>Now in west Africa it’s in countries which have really struggled to rebuild their health systems in urban areas and in rural areas, and where there’s not so much trust as there is in these rural communities and as a result it’s been very difficult to stop the outbreak in these countries.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> And are such outbreaks predictable? Should we have been able to see the Ebola crisis?</p> <p><strong>DH</strong> When an Ebola outbreak occurs it’s caused by a random event; it’s an event that no one can predict. It’s an event that gets the virus which is in an animal or in a bat into a human and then within the human population it spreads from person to person. This is non predictable, although many people would like to be able to predict using genetic sequences or other information about organisms that are carried by animals, to date it’s not been possible to predict when and where an outbreak will occur.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> There was a time when it was said that infectious diseases were all but conquered. Will we ever get to that position do you think?</p> <p><strong>DH</strong> Well I think that was a premature statement back in the 1960s and it’s clear that we never will get to that position, because even if we do deal with all infectious diseases and have drugs and vaccines there’s still the problem of antimicrobial resistance to the drugs we use to treat them. There’s the problem of mutation and escape from protection from one vaccine, a whole series of things that will maintain infectious diseases as a problem, but hopefully in developing countries not the problem that it is today where over a third of the population dies from infectious disease.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> So with no predictability and the certain occurrence of infectious disease we can only try to best prepare ourselves and vulnerable countries by mobilising organisations and governments to put in place strong healthcare systems, something which we have failed to do.</p> <p>I spoke to Mohga Kamal-Yanni, senior health and policy adviser at Oxfam.</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> It’s a complicated situation really, but if you have had a good health system with trained health workers I think we would have picked up the outbreak earlier and dealt with it earlier, but the fact that particularly the three countries have very weak health systems, very few doctors for the population they have, and they’re not trained, really made it very difficult to control the spread.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> That would be the case throughout other countries in west Africa too I’m assuming?</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> Yes, it is. I mean if you look at Sierra Leone for example, the population of Sierra Leone is 6 million, then you have 136 doctors for the 6 million, the likelihood is that the majority of them will be in the capital and major cities and then you have rural areas where the spread happened with hardly any doctors. In Liberia we have 51 doctors for a population of 4.4 million people.</p> <p>Neighbouring countries will be more or less the same, you know, hovering round these figures, and also it’s not just the sheer number of health workers, but it’s also their training and it’s also where they are. Like Nigeria for example, they controlled Ebola because the patient who had Ebola was in a big city, you had a hospital, you had a lab, you had a doctor who knew what they were doing, while if it was a rural area then we, you know, it would be out of control.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> I presume in a rural area you could quite easily miss Ebola couldn’t you, because you’d have people turning up with fever, you’d then have people dying in a fairly horrible way, but it wouldn’t necessarily mean that a doctor who knew what it was would see it.</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> Yeah, exactly, because in rural areas we have less numbers of health workers and they’re not trained to diagnose Ebola. I mean the fact is this is the first time we have Ebola in west Africa, so it’s a new disease, it’s unknown for these people. You know, once we, like the country or WHO, somebody recognises here is an Ebola infection coming in this country then we don’t have the people to train or to diagnose Ebola, we don’t have the labs where you can send samples and actually get an accurate diagnosis and you don’t have the facility to look to isolate the patient and look after it, we don’t have the gear for the health workers to protect themselves. So it’s a lot more than just the number of health workers, which are important, but also other parts of the health system are not there, or are very weak anyway.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> So what are the risks? Professor Heymann again.</p> <p><strong>DH</strong> Well, in a world where there’s an infectious disease in one country with globalisation the whole world is vulnerable to that infectious disease, so this disease could spread anywhere. What’s important is that all countries have in place a system that will enable their general practitioners or their primary healthcare staff to know when a fever comes in from West Africa, what to do to determine whether or not this person might have Ebola, to get the testing done and to isolate them if there’s Ebola.</p> <p>And at the same time hospitals must be prepared with the protective equipment and other supplies necessary to make sure that it doesn’t spread in hospitals and cause community outbreaks by leaving hospitals with health workers into the community.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> I asked Mohga whether very extensive improvements to health systems are needed.</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> Yes, and we must really remember that OK, this time it’s Ebola, it did surprise the whole world because it never happened in west Africa, it was always the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Uganda, and now a totally different strain. We don’t know what will happen tomorrow, we don’t know what else is around the corner in terms of other viruses and other infections and all that, on top of the current health situation, you know, the current disease profile you’ve got these outbreaks.</p> <p>So it does definitely need a new way or a different way of thinking, not just at a national level but also at a global level. And a few days ago, the president of Liberia, she called for the donors to help them by investing in strengthening the health system over a long time. And as you know, a health system, you can’t just press a button and then you have doctors and nurses, you have to invest years in education which is not health systems, that’s education, so that you have the people whom you can train to be healthcare managers, planners, financial officers, on top of doctors and nurses and lab technicians and midwives and community health workers and all that.</p> <p>Once the outbreak is controlled, OK, how do we build on what we learned from the outbreak, you know, all these community workers that are being trained now to deal with it, how we can get these people to be part of the health system and to improve their ability. Meantime while we’re training other health workers, while we are building rural health units and small hospitals in towns, you know, like a referral centre, while we’re building information systems.</p> <p>So it really needs good planning and a good political commitment for long term, so we need governments and donors to say here is the five years’ plan or even 10 years’ plan if we can for the health system, let’s say in Sierra Leone. We will do that in year one, in year two, in year three, it will cost that amount, Sierra Leone can mobilise that amount of money and then the rest should come from donors and then so and so will provide the technical assistance to help them to go through it.</p> <p>If we don’t do this really good concrete planning and concrete financial assistance for the countries then the worry is that once Ebola goes from the headlines then we’re back to square one until we have the next outbreak.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> So when it comes to the World Health Organisation it is said that mistakes were made, that they were too slow in their response. Do you think that’s true and if so, what was the reason for it?</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> To be honest, I think everybody was slow, including the WHO. Now for the WHO there’s like a complicated set of reasons, I mean one thing for the slowness of everybody is, “what, Ebola in west Africa?” And so it’s like strange and somehow it took everybody time to react.</p> <p>For the WHO itself there’s a number of reasons. One is the funding of the WHO which is not a sudden thing, it’s been a problem simmering for the past oh, many, many years and funding WHO is a problem in two ways. One, the quantity of funding, the whole budget for the WHO is like the budget of a big hospital, say in the UK or in the US so it’s not gigantic funding, it’s like funding one hospital. So that amount has not increased as the responsibility of the WHO and the problems with global health have become more complicated and more demanding on the WHO. So the absolute amount of funding is a problem.</p> <p>But the other thing is how that funding is given to the WHO, so over the years earmarked funding has been increasing at the expense of general budget support. So donors pick the best countries, and others, they pick up the programmes or the departments that they like and they fund them, so you have more money in a particular department or in a particular function and nothing next door.</p> <p>And part of this next door was the global health security, so the funding for picking up outbreaks and dealing with outbreaks has decreased and therefore the number of experts in these areas have decreased, people just either walked out or they were sacked.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> And indeed the world seems to be been jolted awake to this shocking situation. At the recent World Bank-IMF meeting, Christine Lagarde, head of the IMF, said that this was clearly an instance when donors must rally round, and that the UN estimates it will take around $1bn to stop the outbreak.</p> <p>The three leaders of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone pleaded for speedy action. Here is President Ernest Bai Koroma of Sierra Leone.</p> <p><strong>EBK</strong> The general international response has up to this moment been slower than the rate of transmission of the disease. This slower than the virus response needs to change. I hereby seek the acceleration of the translation of commitments to physical facts on the ground. That is what is urgently needed now, commitments on paper and commitments during meetings are good, but commitments as physical facts on the ground are best.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> And UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon made clear the urgent need for the injection of finances from donors worldwide.</p> <p><strong>BK-M</strong> Cases are growing exponentially. We need at least, as I said, a 20-fold surge in assistance – mobile laboratories, vehicles, helicopters, protective equipment, trained medical personnel and medevac capabilities. We must work together to provide the best standard of care for each individual or things will get worse before they get better. How much worse depends on us, the international community. So to all who have pledged I say today please deliver now, and for those who have yet to pledge I saw today please do so soon. That’s my urgent appeal.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> I asked Dr Marie-Paule Kieny, assistant director general for health systems and innovation at the WHO, whether she felt shortages of money had affected the organisation’s response to the Ebola outbreak.</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> Well certainly, because over the past years and since the end of a pandemic, if I may say where the teams which were involved in outbreak response and pandemic preparedness at that time before the pandemic have been quite well resourced but in the aftermath of a pandemic there has been certainly shortages of funds there and these teams have been decimated if I may say. So we have not had as much operational capacity as we have had a decade ago, let’s say.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> So what needs to happen in the future, both in the countries and also at the WHO? You need stronger healthcare systems clearly in countries like Sierra Leone don’t you?</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> Yes absolutely, this is something which is very important and we are working on it. Also you know that the World Health Organisation is promoting upon request of the member states universal health coverage and to be able to work towards universal health coverage you need to have decent and functional health systems.</p> <p>So we need also to integrate a bit more the different parts of health systems because when you look at experts or the people working in time of peace if I may say they see their health system as the one who does vaccination and surgery and taking care of mother and child health and you have the other part of the health system which is the one which is seen by the people who do infectious disease. And there has always been pressure that actually the health system which responds to infectious disease is not the same, whereas it is the same and in countries there are only so many people who are dealing with that.</p> <p>So what we need to do and the change that we need to make I think when we talk to a country about health systems is to have this integration saying all these pieces belong to the same system, so if you try to reinforce health systems for universal health coverage you need also to make sure that in doing this you also reinforce them in order to be able to detect infectious disease and to be able to control outbreaks.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> I presume that means more physicians, more nurses, more facilities as well doesn’t it?</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> It does, but it does also mean more surveillance. You know there’s a lot of things that can be done in the health systems, also not only by doctors and nurses, you can have mid-level and lower-level cadres or technicians who can do quite a lot of this work also. So we have to rethink the health systems that we have.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> It’s going to be a massive rebuilding project. I heard somebody estimating that just to restore Liberia’s health system would cost something like $2bn or something enormous.</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> Yes, these numbers are just appalling when you think about it.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> Yes. Do you think that the money and the willpower will be there to do this?</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> Well I hope so because as you know quite often whenever the limelight has gone somewhere else then promises are forgotten and pledges are not always followed by action, but I really hope that it will not be the case. You know, it’s not only when we discuss about rebuilding the health systems in Liberia and Guinea and Sierra Leone, it’s not only rebuilding them because they were really crappy so you don’t want to rebuild them, you need to build them differently.</p> <p>You see in low income countries when they make progress they don’t always use the same tools as we have been using in high income countries, for example, e-health and everything which is to information and communication technology is something that some of them are able to use fantastically to remedy for the small number of competent doctors and also the fact that they have remote areas which are very poorly served. So the rebuilding needs to be with other ingredients, not what we had before.</p> <p><strong>DH</strong> Certainly what we need to do is make sure that the WHO has the resources right and its priorities right. You know, even if there’s a decrease in resources in an organisation the prioritisation is what’s important, sun-setting or stopping certain programmes that aren’t a priority and moving resources to others that might be a priority.</p> <p>In that prioritisation process it’s always difficult because there are interests of various countries for their goals and their desires and their needs and it’s very difficult to come to a consensus on what really is a priority and what isn’t, so many times all activities remain but just at a decreased level of funding.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> Would you like to see a stronger World Health Organisation?</p> <p><strong>DH</strong> Yes, I think the World Health Organisation is incredibly important in the world and if it can be strengthened to do the job as it has done in the past then I think it’s a very important organisation to maintain. There’s no other organisation that looks out for the health of developing countries as does WHO.</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> It’s that worry about once it goes from the headlines what will happen, it will be just the WHO speaking in an empty space because once the media starts talking about something else, whether it’s health or I don’t know, Afghanistan or Iraq or something then governments in the rich countries start talking about that thing and forget about Ebola, and it’s nice to forget about it because if you forget about it you don’t have any commitment or you just put a little amount of money and that’s it, you know. Wash your hands, and that’s what we were worried about, we were worried about the donor’s community washing their hands from west Africa until the next stage.</p> <p>And the other thing that we’re worried about now is that the focus is on the three countries that are affected, but it doesn’t seem to be donor’s help going into the neighbouring countries where there’s a threat. I mean now that there is a case in Mali they have the time to prepare now but I don’t know it they have the support, whether it’s support technically or whether it’s with gear and material, staff or money.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> So who would actually take the lead with this? Who could go to say, Mali, and say we will help you put in all the infrastructure and so on that you need to prevent this happening? Is that going to be, again it won’t be the WHO will it, it has to be the donors because they have the money, they have the ability to help, but who would do it?</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> Actually, the WHO is trying to help some of these countries with whatever they have, I mean they do have country people. The UN has set up this system of coordination and that should be working. Whether that system would take the lead in talking with the donors and saying right okay, you know, maybe France would help Senegal, maybe I don’t know, the UK would help Côte d’Ivoire or somebody else. So that UN Ebola response coordination can take the lead in organising the donors around supporting the countries.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> The need for change may be there, but how hopeful are organisations such as Oxfam that it will happen and that both governments and the WHO will take responsibility for seeing it through.</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> I’m not sure to be honest, I’m not sure if member states really took notice of what’s going on and are really taking their responsibility for that situation rather than just blaming the WHO. I think that’s the critical thing, will the member states, particularly the donors, particularly the ones that have money, you know, because developing countries are interested in funding the WHO but they don’t have the money to do it. The people who don’t seem to be interested in empowering the WHO, if you like, are the ones who have the money, so you’ve got this paradoxical situation.</p> <p>And just remember, this funding, the total budget of the WHO rather than earmarked, I mean basically it doesn’t mean that you’re giving the funding and say right OK, you run with it, do whatever you like, it’s not like that, because the WHO is one, as you know it’s probably unique in the global system, in the UN system, in terms of it’s governed by its members. So through the member states via the World Health Assembly actually decide on the plan for the WHO so for the next three years you’re going to do this, that and the other. But then the budget doesn’t match the plan.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> Do we need better leadership at the WHO, and surely it should be their role to push through or to assist with the reconstruction of healthcare in these affected countries and to bolster them? So if it has to be done, if we have to rebuild the healthcare systems of Sierra Leone and Liberia and Guinea it should be the WHO that pushes that ahead surely?</p> <p><strong>MK-Y</strong> The WHO is not an implementing agency so they’re not going to build the health system in Sierra Leone or in any country, but they have this advocacy, if you like policy function, of saying why this is important, how you could do it, guiding the country and doing it and making it a serious global issue, if you like. For that, the WHO needs to have the capacity to do this, yes it does need very strong leadership to do that, but don’t forget the role of the donors, the WHO’s always kind of taking it easy with the big donors because they’re the ones who give the money.</p> <p>Until that changes, it’s very difficult, you know, you put the leadership in a difficult situation, whoever is there, if they speak loudly do they upset the donor then they might be threatened by not being funded or more earmarked and less budget. So it’s a very tricky situation, but we certainly need strong leadership that can stand against all the donors’ commercial and other interests.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> And did Dr Kierny think there is a need to strengthen the WHO?</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> Absolutely, that’s going to be very important also, certainly, and I think also we need to understand how to better ourselves, get organised, but clearly the fact that we receive not enough funding but also the money that we receive is quite often highly earmarked so this is that we receive money which is to do one project or another project and cannot be used for anything else.</p> <p>So the way we are financed and the way we operate has been a subject of much debate by our member states for many years, so I hope that this and other elements will help them think of how they can make sure that the organisation is fit for purpose.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> In a way, that discussion needs to happen now doesn’t it, while the world’s attention is on this particular crisis?</p> <p><strong>M-PK</strong> Absolutely.</p> <p><strong>SB</strong> That brings us to the end of this edition of the Global development podcast.

http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/04/ebola-sierra-leone-small-scale-mining-sector-catastropic-consequences <p>Ebola is having catastrophic economic consequences for Sierra Leone, where the disease is running rampant. </p> <p>The country, together with the two other Mano River Union states, Liberia and Guinea, are presently in economic paralysis. Despite being natural resource-rich countries, inflation, food prices and currency exchange rates have soared, international investors have fled, and industries have come to a grinding halt. World Bank estimates suggest that the Ebola outbreak could <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/afr/publication/the-economic-impact-of-the-2014-ebola-epidemic-short-and-medium-term-estimates-for-west-africa">cost the West African economy $32.6bn</a> (£20.3bn) by the end of 2015, unless the epidemic is rapidly contained.</p> <p>In Sierra Leone, the macro-economic impacts of the crisis came into sharp focus two weeks ago, when the country’s second largest iron ore producer, <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/16/london-mining-fight-ebola-sierra-leone-goes-bust">London Mining, went into administration</a>. The London-listed company was one of the country’s largest employers, providing jobs for 1,400 local people at its mine in Marampa, and contributing an estimated 10% to GDP. While the company has been hard hit by a 40% drop in the global price of iron ore, it seems that the disruption caused by the Ebola epidemic served as the final nail in the coffin.</p> <p>The Ebola crisis is having <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/28/ebola-africa-symptom-failing-economic-system-west-deforestation">devastating consequences</a> on Sierra Leone’s macro-economy, but it is also having far reaching knock-on effects at the micro-level, suppressing informal livelihood opportunities for poor people. This is particularly the case for those who are dependent on artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) – low-tech, labour-intensive mineral extraction and processing activities that generate disposable income for hundreds of thousands of families in an employment-constrained economy.</p> <p>With many parts of the country in effective quarantine and regional trade routes blocked off, there are enormous logistical challenges for ASM. It is Sierra Leone’s second largest employer after agriculture and provides a livelihood for an estimated 200,000-300,000 individuals and their families. It is also an activity that is characterised by a high degree of mobility, and it often takes place in confined spaces where there is poor hygiene. While the spread of Ebola has forced many ASM operators to abandon mining altogether, tight border controls implemented to halt the spread of disease have also made activities within the ASM sector increasingly difficult.</p> <p>ASM does not merely generate income for poor people, but it interlocks closely with a host of other downstream and ancillary activities <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yw2pEcauGt8">that drive the rural economy</a>. This micro-economy is defined by seasonal migratory labour streams, where individuals straddle different productive activities throughout the year, by moving freely between various geographic locations. </p> <p>Artisanal diamond operators often combine farming and mining, with mining being undertaken predominantly in the dry season when river levels are low, and farming being carried out mainly during the rainy season. The income generated from diamond mining is frequently reinvested into farming, or the expansion of cash crops, such as coffee, cocoa and kola nuts. </p> <p> Restrictions on the movement of people have severely curtailed both artisanal diamond and gold mining. Before the crisis, artisanal gold mining, being a female-dominated activity, provided a steady and reliable income for women. Gold revenue contributed to the cost of essential household expenses, including food, clothes, school fees and books, and family medical costs. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="85316dc1f9784c4213604b1c68838252ef084122"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/11/4/1415100796133/71c0e0eb-df28-46e8-9bcb-e32c06aba293-460x276.jpeg" alt="Women mining gold in Kono, Sierra Leone" width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">Women mining gold in Kono, Sierra Leone.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: Roy Maconachie</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>These earnings also provided women with the necessary ‘start-up’ capital to create farming associations, revive agricultural labour clubs and rebuild trading networks that were rendered dysfunctional during the war. This prominent gender dimension to the sector suggests that artisanal gold mining is, in normal circumstances, an important vehicle for alleviating poverty and enhancing food security, as it puts income directly into the hands of women. </p> <p>Restrictions on movement are not only affecting producers, but also buyers, many of whom travel from as far as Guinea to do business. Reports indicate that sourcing patterns are also being affected. Buyers in Surat, India, where an estimated 80% of the world’s diamonds are cut and polished, have stopped sending their traders to West Africa and have even <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/Ebola-outbreak-dulls-diamond-industry/articleshow/41906802.cms">returned parcels originating from Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea</a>, over fears of the disease.</p> <p>Everyday life in rural Sierra Leone is a challenge at the best of times, with many people in the alluvial mining areas experiencing some of the worst poverty in the country. While Ebola has had a devastating effect on the mining sector – both large-scale, like London Mining, and small-scale – the predominant national response to restrict mobility has been particularly damaging to the ASM sector and the livelihoods of those it supports. </p> <p>It has had an impact upon the day-to-day survival of hundreds of thousands of people within the gold and diamondiferous areas of the country. This indicates that managing the risk of further contagion is a doubly challenging task, given that the trade networks and population mobility that define the rural economy are also potential pathways to spread the disease further. </p> <p>Ebola control must involve a process of rapid identification of cases, followed by removal and isolation of those infected for treatment. Public health education is also key. But a truly holistic approach to containing the disease, without cutting the lifelines that support the livelihoods of Sierra Leone’s rural inhabitants, must first start with a detailed understanding from all agencies involved, of the country’s rural landscapes and an appreciation of the micro-economic patterns and processes that are central to rural society.</p> <p><em>Roy Maconachie is senior lecturer in international development at the University of Bath</em></p> <p><strong>Read more stories like this:</strong><br /></p> <ul> <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/28/ebola-africa-symptom-failing-economic-system-west-deforestation">Ebola is a product of a destructive and exploitative global economic system </a></li> <li><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/nov/03/developing-nations-lose-100bn-tax-revenue-g20-reforms-avoidance">Developing nations lose $100bn in tax revenue each year - will G20 reforms help?</a></li> <li><strong>Brought to you by Business Call to Action</strong>: <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/oct/31/from-emerging-to-multinational-leaders-shaping-new-models-to-meet-the-bop">From emerging to multinational: leaders shaping new models to meet the BoP </a><br /></li> </ul> <p><em><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/role-business-development">The role of business in development</a> hub is funded by Business Call to Action.

http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/03/maine-nurse-final-week-ebola-monitoring <p>The nurse who challenged Maine’s quarantine policy for healthcare workers returning from west Africa must monitor her health for one more week, but is free to leave her home under a deal reached on Monday. </p> <p>The state of Maine and lawyers for the nurse, Kaci Hickox, agreed to make permanent the terms of a temporary court order issued <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/oct/31/maine-nurse-ebola-guidelines-judge-lifts-order">on Friday</a> by judge Charles C LaVerdiere, the chief judge for the state’s district courts.</p> <p>“It’s excellent,” Steve Hyman, one of Hickox’s lawyers, said. The agreement brings to a close the first legal attempt by a state to enforce a quarantine policy on healthcare workers returning from Ebola-affected region of west Africa. </p> <p>Hickox, 33, must monitor her health and report any <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/ebola">Ebola symptoms</a> until her 21-day incubation period ends at 11.59pm on 10 November. She is not, however, restricted from leaving her home and visiting public places. She also must coordinate travel with health officials so her monitoring isn’t interrupted.</p> <p><a href="http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/maine">Maine</a> officials had attempted to bar Hickox from public gatherings and force her to stay 3ft from others, but on Friday the judge lifted those requirements, even though they abided by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines.</p> <p>While Hickox is free from quarantine, her boyfriend, Ted Wilbur, with whom she lives in Fort Kent, is keeping away from the University of Maine campus where he is a nursing student. </p> <p>Wilbur told reporters he was asked to stay away from campus while Hickox is under monitoring, but the university said the decision was reached mutually.</p> <p>Ray Phinney, the associate dean of student life and development at the University of Maine at Fort Kent, said the decision to stay away is voluntary, and that the school is willing to reconsider the agreement. He said the university worked to accommodate Wilbur, offering him the option to take his classes online. </p> <p>Phinney said the decision was made to ensure students feel safe on campus, which he described as small. “We understand the science behind [the Ebola virus], but also that there are legitimate fears among communities,” he said.</p> <p>Speaking to <a href="http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/hickox-clarifies-her-self-quarantine-plan-n239561">NBC’s Meet the Press </a>on Sunday, Hickox said Wilbur should be allowed to return to school, as he poses no threat to others. The agreement remained in effect on Monday.</p> <p>Still, Hickox said she was sympathetic to those in her town, and implied that she would stay away from public places even though she is not restricted from doing so. </p> <p>“I will not go into town, into crowded public places,” she told NBC. “You know, I have had a few friends come visit me in my home, and that’s absolutely fantastic.”</p> <p>Hickox became the center of a contentious debate on how to treat healthcare workers returning from Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone after she was detained at Newark airport in New Jersey. Despite testing negative for Ebola and displaying no symptoms, she was kept in an isolation tent at an area hospital for some days before Chris Christie, the New Jersey governor, agreed to her release. </p> <p>She returned to her home in Fort Kent, a small town near the Canadian border, where state officials attempted to place her under quarantine. Hickox refused, even threatening to defy the quarantine order if it was not lifted. She left her home for the first time on Thursday.</p> <p>New York and New Jersey’s mandatory 21-day quarantine policy inspired similar requirements in several states across the US, despite widespread criticism from the medical establishment, the White House and the UN.</p> <p>Hickox and her lawyers argued that the state-mandated quarantine measure was not based on science, and infringed on her civil liberties. </p> <p>Hyman, Hickox’s lawyer, said he hopes other states weighing restrictive quarantine policies on healthcare workers take note of the judge’s decision, but he said he is not optimistic.<br /></p> <p>“We are troubled that other states seem to be mimicking New York and New Jersey and have imposed restrictions that make no medical sense,” he said.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/nov/03/profiting-from-ebola-is-it-immoral-to-invest-in-companies-that-benefit-from-pandemics <p>An epidemic jumps from country to country, propelled thousands of miles over land and sea by the ease of modern travel. Researchers at pharmaceutical companies are racing to find a vaccine, a cure, a treatment. <br /></p> <p>You invest in their stocks, just helping to save lives. You are one of the good guys, adding resources to the fight. Right? But you are also betting on more and more people getting sick and on getting a pretty rich return for yourself.</p> <p>This is a moral quandary. People profit from bad events. It happens all the time. We all sneer at war profiteers, but entire economies benefited in the economic boom following the second world war. Defense stocks, like <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/09/22/investing/defense-stocks-isis-bounce/">Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, hit record highs</a> last month when the terrorist group Isis stepped up its threat. </p> <p>Turn on <a href="http://www.marketwatch.com/story/ebola-stocks-mostly-higher-after-virus-confirmed-in-new-york-2014-10-24">any</a> <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102118006">financial</a> <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/lakeland-reports-1-million-hazmat-suit-orders-2014-10">news</a> <a href="http://online.barrons.com/articles/investing-and-ebola-the-hazmat-trade-1413610266">these days</a>, and the talk is how to profit from Ebola. Stocks in vaccines, experimental new treatments, even hazmat suits are showing speculative pops. Companies you’ve never heard of before, such as Sarepta and Tekmira and Lakeland, are dominating attention. Morbidly, even New York City’s body bag supplier, <a href="http://nypost.com/2014/10/16/dont-say-ebola-on-the-radio-fdny-to-911-dispatchers/">Basheer Mahar of Salam International, Inc</a>, is quoted in the press assuring the city that he has “more than 100,000 bags on hand.” Business is booming.</p> <p>Let’s say you invested in a speculative small stock such as Lakeland Industries, which makes contamination suits and safety gear. You hedged your bets and put money in pharmaceutical companies developing experimental drugs, such as Sarepta, Tekmira, and BioCryst . You even threw a few dollars at DuPont and Honeywell, the behemoths of protective gear. You got in before the stocks popped in price, and settled down to ride the rise. </p>  <figure class="element element-image" data-media-id="840691b4a96913abcb86a24f239ec4b1a8469040"> <img src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2014/10/30/1414698854933/00844a31-af8e-4d56-be75-1268a7c4c218-460x276.jpeg" alt="World Health Organisation staff check a package of the experimental Ebola vaccine VSE-EBOV at a hospital in Geneva, Switzerland." width="460" height="276" class="gu-image" /> <figcaption> <span class="element-image__caption">World Health Organisation staff check a package of the experimental Ebola vaccine VSE-EBOV at a hospital in Geneva, Switzerland.</span> <span class="element-image__credit">Photograph: MATHILDE MISSIONEIRO / WHO / HANDOUT/EPA</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>But by taking advantage in the rally in Ebola-related stocks are you worse than your friend who invests in Starbucks and Apple? Is betting more people will want a cup of coffee and a fancy new phone a more moral investment strategy than waiting for confirmed Ebola cases to rise?</p> <p>Not exactly, said three ethicists interviewed by the Guardian. </p> <p>“That’s how markets benefit society,” explains Thomas Donaldson, professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School. “Investing is wrong when I know that my investment will cause more harm than good or violate a core human value,” explained Donaldson. </p> <p>So while it may seem strange that in some indirect way these stocks are benefiting from the panic over Ebola, and perhaps news stories can be more sensitive when touting the rising stock prices or highlighting a pharmaceutical company that has an Ebola vaccine in its pipeline that no one has noticed yet, there is nothing ethically wrong in benefiting from the investment. </p> <p>The system we have in place requires private investors – you and I – to fund drug discovery. Pharmaceutical companies operate for profit. They research those drugs that will get them more revenue and a higher stock price. Whatever their motivation, pharmaceutical companies make drugs that save lives.</p> <p>Drug development is a tricky business, and an expensive one. Literally billions are spent each year on research to find new and better drugs to treat humanity’s ills. A popular estimate is that it takes $1bn (£620m) or more to discover and develop one new drug. So educate yourself well, and know that you are taking a big bet, but perhaps one that may save some lives, even if it does so indirectly simply by demonstrating which drugs and target molecules don’t work. It is one of the rare cases where a bad investment can at least still have some benefit. <br /></p> <p>So invest away. But remember, betting on any drug company can be pretty speculative. When it comes to success, only one in 10 drugs make it all the way from concept to clinic, according to some studies.</p> <p>Virologist Jonas Salk famously did not patent his polio vaccine, forgoing profits, so that it could be widely and cheaply available to the world’s population. Most of us live in a less perfect reality. <br /></p> <p>“Benevolence is a motive far superior to that of self-interest and we should encourage everyone to cultivate it,” says Donaldson. “Yet, self-interest is a more reliable basis for organising our economy and securing economic welfare.” </p> <p>And investors motivate for-profit companies to focus on whatever seems to provide the biggest return. So investing in companies because they are working on treatments for Ebola directly motivates a company to complete research on their pipeline drugs, as well as providing the capital for that research. </p> <p>It can also be argued that whatever the motivation of the investor, the end result – more funding for research or the production of protective gear – is what really matters. “For those who might be future beneficiaries, it might not matter what was the motivation.” points out Hersh Shefrin, finance professor at Santa Clara University’s Leavey school of business, whose work focuses on behavioral finance.</p> <p>Putting money into stocks that experience a pop because of the panic over Ebola and then taking your money out before the stock price drops again may be more dubious morally.<br /></p> <p>“Some people’s personal ethics will lead them to feel that it’s not right to benefit from the tragedy of others. If so, they can always identify the gain from ‘Ebola-investments’ and donate those to a worthy cause, without removing the financial incentive necessary to fight the disease”, points out Shefrin, highlighting the need to fund research into vaccines and better treatments. </p> <p>“I think most people would say it’s permissible to invest in these stocks. If one were entirely unmoved by the plight of those suffering from Ebola, that would be callous. But one might be very sad about what is happening to them, and yet glad that one’s stocks are rising.” says Roger Crisp, professor of moral philosophy, Uehiro fellow and tutor in philosophy at St Anne’s College, Oxford. </p> <p>To paraphrase Churchill, the system of for profit pharmaceutical companies and speculating investors is the worse system there is – except for all the other ones.</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/02/africa-cup-of-nations-morocco-ebola <p>A decision over whether Morocco will host the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations (CAN) tournament is expected on Monday after a day of meetings between the Confederation of African Football (Caf) and Moroccan authorities.</p> <p>The north African country asked for the tournament – due to begin on 17 January – <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/16/morocco-africa-cup-of-nations-ebola-withdraw" title="">to be postponed due to the risk of the spread of the Ebola virus</a> affecting western Africa.</p> <p>According to reports from the Algeria Press Service, the executive committee of the Caf met the federation’s president, Issa Hayatou, the Algerian Football Federation president, Mohamed Rauraua, and the Egyptian CAF delegate, Hani Abourida, on Sunday.</p> <p>After recommendations from the national Health Ministry and the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Moroccan Ministry of Sport had asked for the tournament to be postponed to an unspecified date.</p> <p>“Our concern is the health of Africa and, based on WHO reports and guidelines, we have to listen,” said the sports minister, Mohamed Ouzzine.</p> <p>“Zero safety does not exist but one has to take the necessary precautions so that the coming tournament will be a football feast, bringing together our African brothers. But given the current Ebola situation we don’t think such a feast can take place as expected.”</p> <p>However, the Manchester City and Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Touré, who played in his club side’s 1-0 victory over Manchester United on Sunday, believes the tournament should take place as scheduled.</p> <p>“Me, I’m not really afraid,” <a href="http://www.europe1.fr/sport/football/articles/yaya-toure-j-espere-qu-on-pourra-jouer-la-can-2277537" title="">Touré told French radio station Europe 1 on Saturday</a>. “A very strong psychosis exists about this epidemic. The CAN is very important for Africa. It needs to take place.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2014/nov/02/rand-paul-temporary-halt-elective-travel-ebola-countries <p>Rand Paul, the Republican senator from Kentucky, has called for the US to enact a “temporary stop” of “elective travel” for people coming from west African nations that have seen Ebola outbreaks even as he questioned the quarantine of a Maine nurse who has tested negative for the disease.</p> <p>“If you’re coming to visit your relatives, couldn’t that wait for a few months?” <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/limit-elective-travel-from-west-africa-to-curb-ebola-spread-sen-rand-paul-says/">he said on CBS’s Face the Nation</a> on Sunday. “What I’m saying is elective travel, commercial travel for people who just want to visit the United States, that really isn’t a necessity.”<br /></p> <p>“The American public sees people getting it who are fully masked and gowned and saying, ‘My goodness, I don’t think anybody should be riding on a bus or coming from Liberia to visit their aunt or uncle when they could be contagious,” he said. </p> <p>He said the ban should not apply to humanitarian aid workers. <br /></p> <p>Paul, a doctor, has come under criticism recently for other statements about Ebola that seem to contradict that of medical officials. Last month, he accused the White House of underplaying how transmissible the disease is, suggesting it was more contagious than Aids. “If someone has Ebola at a cocktail party they’re contagious and you can catch it from them,” <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/10/16/politics/rand-paul-ebola-aids/">he said</a> then. </p> <p>Also appearing on CNN’s State of the Union on Sunday, Paul told Candi Crowley quarantines for returning aid workers are “reasonable precautions” but that he was unsettled by the treatment of Kaci Hickox, the Maine nurse who battled the New Jersey governor, Chris Christie, and later the Maine governor, Paul LePage, over their attempts to quarantine her.<br /></p> <p>“The libertarian in me is horrified at the idea of indefinitely detaining or detaining anyone without a trial,” Paul said.<br /></p> <p>“One of the basic rights we inherited from the English and we got from common law was the right of habeas corpus … If the king were detaining you in the Tower of London, or a governor or anybody who is detaining you, you have to have recourse to a lawyer.”<br /></p> <p>“We have to be careful of people’s civil liberties,” he said. “But I’m not saying the government doesn’t have a role in trying to prevent contagion.”</p> <p>In an interview with the Maine Sunday Telegram on Sunday, Hickox defended her fight against the quarantine and said she was hopeful others returning from west Africa would be treated more fairly. </p> <p>“I hope in six months aid workers returning back can be unnoticed,” she told the newspaper. “They won’t be in the media like I was, I hope. And they can walk into a grocery store and maybe no one even knows they were working in a country with Ebola, but one day I hope everyone can know and still smile at them in the grocery store. I know that won’t happen today.”</p>
http://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/nov/02/ebola-deeply-media-syria-deeply <p>The Ebola crisis has brought out the worst in some elements of the western media, prey to exaggeration, scaremongering and shock tactics.</p> <p><a href="http://www.eboladeeply.org" title="">Ebola Deeply</a>, a new single-issue website from the team behind <a href="http://www.syriadeeply.org" title="">Syria Deeply</a>, could help to rectify this situation. As with Syria Deeply, the site offers a mixture of original reporting and aggregation, from a team made up of journalists (many of them on the ground in affected countries), technologists and experts in the field.</p> <p>Lara Setrakian, a former television news correspondent for Bloomberg Television and ABC News who founded parent site <a href="http://www.newsdeeply.com" title="">News Deeply</a> in 2012, describes the company’s model as an “on ramp” for news stories.</p> <p>“There needs to be something that helps get users – readers, viewers – on-boarded to a story, understanding enough of the narrative that they can find the next piece more interesting and engaging,” Setrakian says. “When [the media] fade in and out of reporting on certain issues it becomes very hard for our audience to catch up on what happened in the space between.”</p> <p>The two sites offer a similar mixture of content, including op-ed pieces from a network of experts, maps, timelines, videos, executive summaries, aggregated news from around the world and the Syria/Ebola Files, collections of text and interactive materials designed to help readers understand the background to the current situation.</p> <p>“We see ourselves as a supplement, almost like a vitamin – vitamin Syria,” Setrakian explains. “The notion of a universal story page is very helpful for our readers and it is also just like journalism in the public service, when we were talking about radio or television, except for now it is digital.”</p> <p>This might, on the face of it, sound like a reaction to the failings of mainstream media. But Setrakian believes the problem is more rudimentary. “It is not the fault of any one news organisation. It is simply the systematic outcome of general-interest news reporting and a very complex world,” she says. “Some of the news coverage [of Ebola] has definitely stoked hysterical fears. But it is just the nature of the story that is so frightening. Even the most straight-forward news coverage is going to stoke fears.”</p> <p>The origins of News Deeply lie in Setrakian’s experience as a Middle East correspondent for ABC News. She loved the job, she says, but became aware of a systemic gap in the linear reporting that mainstream news outlets produce.</p> <p>“A news piece would come and go and the story, the issue itself, would still be there,” she said. “There was still so much unaccounted for. There was only really a limited amount of information you could pack into a two or three or even seven and eight minute piece.”</p> <p>After discussing her ambitions and frustrations with Azeo Fables, a technologist with a background in startups and project management, the pair launched Syria Deeply in 2012. “People thought I was crazy – even my mother thought I was nuts. She could not compute that I left TV to start a website,” Setrakian says. “As a Middle Eastern correspondent I could not just watch this problem continue, without trying a better way of designing our coverage. Syria was too important to leave off the pages for good.”</p> <p>The site quickly found an audience – including “diplomats, Syrians, mostly living abroad, a lot of students of Middle Eastern Studies, professors, think tanks” – and scored a number of scoops, including the news that Isis had issued 11 rules for journalists in Deir Ezzor, which was picked up around the world.</p> <p>Syria Deeply generated interest in the company’s single-issue news model, which in turn led to outside suggestions for other issues that the team should cover. One of these was Ebola.</p> <p>“Syria Deeply was the proof of concept. Ebola Deeply was motivated by people telling us, ‘You need to run this model on Ebola’, which had the same information problem,” Setrakian explains.</p> <p>Fables adds: “The two things that every topic needs are a high need for service and a high opportunity for impact. Ebola Deeply’s launch had good timing because there was a lot going on and no kind of coherent narrative.”</p> <p>All this, however, needs money. Setrakian says they run the company as a “social enterprise” rather than having to rely exclusively on philanthropy.</p> <p>News Deeply does receive grants from a number of public foundations – what Setrakian calls “directed support for a single topic” – but it also makes money by creating white-label platforms for editorial projects and plans to raise funds from events and membership services.</p> <p>“We ruled out a subscription model because we don’t believe in putting this work behind a paywall,” Setrakian says. “We want it to be for public consumption.”</p> <p>Media analyst Ken Doctor compares News Deeply to the Encyclopaedia Britannica and Wikipedia. “Ebola Deeply, and its sister, Syria Deeply, take the abstract question of what would or could journalists do with a Wikipedia model and answer it,” he said.</p> <p>“Top stories, videos, maps and visuals, appropriate Twitter representations, news and views, all neatly packaged on a single page. It’s a reference point that shows you what wide and deep mean – and it’s done on shoestring.”</p> <p>The company’s next project is <a href="http://signup.arcticdeeply.org/?r=http://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0CCMQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Farcticdeeply.org%2F&amp;ei=OdtTVNmtIePe7Ab-m4C4Dw&amp;usg=AFQjCNG5vJtWo35dDtWYAsOkEYx3X8d9mg&amp;sig2=HwED6PjzuOS3EEfnHgy-Cg&amp;bvm=bv.78677474,d.ZGU" title="">Arctic Deeply</a> – a “species-level issue” that is under-reported according to Setrakian – whose pre-launch incubation period started with a round-table event on 31 October. Other topics under consideration include Pakistan, Burma, Congo and water scarcity.</p> <p>“Myanmar has an election next year that is terribly misunderstood,” Setrakian says. “We are looking at Libya. We have looked at places where there just isn’t a spotlight.”</p>
